# climate-predictor

An interactive machine learning project that forecasts the effects of climate change — including temperature shifts — across U.S. states. Users can select a state from a map and see predicted data for future years based on historical climate trends.

## Project Structure


## Features

- Predict average temperature change by state and year
- Simple interactive UI (HTML + JavaScript)
- Machine learning regression model (scikit-learn)
- Flask API backend to serve predictions
- Expandable to include disaster forecasts and real-time data

## How to Run Locally

## Sample Prediction

Once the page loads, a test prediction for Texas in 2035 will display. You can modify the frontend script to hook into an interactive map and dynamically select states and years.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)
- Data Sources: NASA, NOAA, historical climate datasets

## To-Do / Coming Soon

- Hook map click events to prediction API
- Add precipitation and disaster forecasts
- Improve model with time-series forecasting
- Integrate real-time data via APIs
